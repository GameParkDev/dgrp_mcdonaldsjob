Add your title and add your answers below, if you have more information by all means add it, but do not remove any details already existing below, this will void your request and we will not respond if it is not filled out correctly.

**Disclaimer**
Due to the fact that people are providing such little information and expecting us to be able to fix their problem, we are now enforcing these issue templates through github, if you fill these forms out incorrectly or provide little information, then expect little help in return, we, as addon creators spend hours/days/weeks and even months and years doing this for FREE, both creating addons and giving support, so please show some courtesy and atleast have a fair go at diagnosing and fixing your problem before creating a post and possibly wasting not only your own time, but the people that are trying to create resources for server owners like you.
